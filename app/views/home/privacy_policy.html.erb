    </p>

    <p>

    We may provide these Services ourselves or share the information with partners who will provide the services for us. We may use aggregated user data to market the Service or the Platform to others.
    </p>

    <h5>How do we share your Personal Information? </h5>
    <p>

    We will not disclose Personal Information of our users to any persons or entities outside of our company, nor lease, license, rent, transfer, disclose, disseminate or otherwise grant access to such information unless: 
    </p>
    <p>

    •    We must share user information in order to provide a product or service that has been ordered or requested by that user, in which case we will require that any third person or entity we use to fulfill the order agrees that it does not have the right to use user information other than to fulfill the order or request;•    It is required or reasonably necessary to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of us, our users, employees, minors, members of the public and/or our Platform.
    </p>
    <p>

 We may also disclose information about you to our auditors or legal advisors in conjunction with accessing our disclosure obligations and/or rights under this Policy.
    </p>

    <h5>Types and disclosures of aggregate information </h5>
    <p>

    We may share aggregated information concerning our users, without attribution of Personal Information, to other companies with whom we conduct business. In other words, we may combine your anonymized data with those of all or a particular group of our users to prepare collective profiles of our users and their activities for our internal use and can share the same with our partners. Such information allows us to continue to grow and provide you with quality information through higher quality product development, more relevant partnerships, and more accurate marketing and advertising of the Platform. For example, we may use and/or share the following:
    </p>

    <p>

    •    Tracked number of our users who view certain pages or use certain features.
    </p>

    <h5>What do we do to keep your Personal Information secure?</h5>

    <p>

    We take commercially reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of your Personal Information that you share and we collect and store. These security measures include practices such as:
    </p>
    <p>

    •    Keeping sensitive or Personal Information on a secured server behind a firewall.•    Using secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology.
    </p>
    <p>

    Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Platform cannot be guaranteed and you transmit such information at your own risk; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.
    </p>

    <h5>What can you do to protect your Personal Information?</h5>
    <p>

    While we are committed to taking all reasonable precautions to protect your Personal Information, there are steps you can take as well when using online services, such as ours:
    </p>
    <p>

    •    Create strong passwords and use them wisely (e.g. don’t use the same password for us that you use for your bank, for example).•    Do not disclose passwords to the Platform or Account Information to any other person.•    If logins are required for site access, be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.
    </p>
    <p>

    Be aware when clicking on hypertext links and third party advertising, if any, on the Platform. Other sites accessible through our Platform, if any, via links or service partnerships have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. We encourage you to review other websites’ policies before revealing any sensitive or personal information. Additionally, if other companies place advertising on our Platform, they may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect. We cannot be and are not responsible for maintaining your privacy once you leave our Platform and are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.
    </p>

    <h5>What can you do if you no longer want to receive communications from us?</h5>

    <p>

    You can opt out of any automated notifications or communications by:
    </p>
    <p>

    •    Contacting us with an unsubscribe request to our email address found at the end of this Policy; however our employees, contractors or agents may still need to contact users who opt out personally, for example, in response to a support inquiry or if that user is in violation of our website terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <p>

    If we have provided any third party with your Personal Information (with your permission) and you subsequently opt-out, you will have to contact the third-party directly with your opt-out request(s).
    </p>

    <h5>Fair Information Practice Principles</h5>

    <p>

    The FTC created the Fair Information Practice Principles as a result of the Commission’s inquiry into the manner in which online entities collect and use personal information and safeguards to ensure that such practices are fair and provide adequate privacy protection. We take our own self-regulation very seriously and support your rights as a consumer to causes of action against disreputable and unprincipled data collectors and users. Consistent with the FTC’s Principles, and in the event of a data breach, we will do the following:
    </p>
    <p>

    •    Notify users by email within 5 business day(s)
    </p>

    <h5>California Residents - California Civil Code Section 1798.83 </h5>

If you are a California resident and wish to obtain such information, submit a request to our email address found at the end of this Policy with “Request for California Privacy Information” as the subject line and in the body of your message. Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.
    </p>

    <h5>How can you update, delete, or correct your personal information? </h5>

    <h5>How we comply with the CAN-SPAM Act</h5>

    </p>

    <p>
    NOT use false or misleading information in the subject line or body of our emails.
    Identify messages as advertisements by using the label “advertisement” in a conspicuous manner.
    Monitor third party email marketing services, if one is used.

    Provide accurate “From” fields so that users know who is sending the email.
    Provide visible and operable unsubscribe mechanisms in all of our emails.
    Include our physical address in the body of our emails.
    Honor any opt-out requests to our emails within 10 business days.

    <h5>What will happen if we change this Policy?</h5>
    <p>

    We may update this Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Policy in effect at the time such information is used. This is how you will be notified if we make any material changes to our Policy:
    </p>
    <p>

    •    We will deliver an email announcement to the email address associated with each user account. It is each user’s responsibility to maintain a valid e-mail address as a registered user. If a user opts out of communications from us, they may not receive these notifications, however the changes will still govern any use of the Service, and users are still responsible for checking for any changes.
    </p>
